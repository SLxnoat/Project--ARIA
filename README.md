# ARIA v2 — Adaptive Role Intelligence Assistant
> Learns YOU first. Guides you second.

---

## What's new in v2

| Feature | v1 | v2 |
|---|---|---|
| Roadmap | Pre-loaded template | **Generated by ARIA from your answers** |
| Projects | Fixed 3 generic ideas | **Suggested based on your actual level** |
| Weekly tasks | None | **Generated per phase, respects your hours/week** |
| First launch | Static welcome screen | **ARIA opens a real conversation** |
| Profile | None | **Built automatically + persisted to JSON** |

---

## How it works

1. **Open ARIA** → It greets you and starts a natural conversation
2. **ARIA learns your level** → discovers your Python experience, AI exposure, goals, available time
3. **Profile fills automatically** → visible live in the "My Profile" tab
4. **Ask for your roadmap** → ARIA generates phases specific to YOU, not a template
5. **Ask for project ideas** → ARIA suggests 3 projects suited to your exact skills
6. **Ask for this week's tasks** → ARIA plans your week around your available hours
7. **Everything is saved** → `aria_profile.json` persists across sessions

## The 5 tabs

| Tab | What it does |
|---|---|
| 💬 Chat | Main interface — talk to ARIA freely |
| 👤 My Profile | Live view of what ARIA knows + manual edit |
| 🗺️ Roadmap | Your generated learning path, phase tracker |
| 🚀 Projects | AI-suggested portfolio projects for your level |

## Tips

- Tell ARIA your hours per week — it uses this for task planning
- Profile tab has manual edit if ARIA misread something
- Sidebar → "🗑️ Reset Everything" for a clean restart
- Sidebar → "💾 Export My Profile" saves your profile as JSON
